Find files, empty filer or delete/destroy files


This Linux script will delete files and make them unrecoverable or very difficult to recover, where special software will be needed because before deleting them we will encode, overwrite, empty and rename them to make things a little more difficult.

Besides, this script can also list the files you want to delete before deleting them or just empty their content in case you want to reuse the names, for example, the programmer logs that locally tend to grow to infinity. With this script you can go through the entire disk looking for *.log and empty them to continue using them.


The way to use the script is:

> Usage:   ./file-seeker.sh <path> <extension> <br>
>  Example: ./file-seeker.sh /path/to/dir txt   (searches .txt files) <br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;    ./file-seeker.sh /path/to/dir '*'   (searches all files)


The script presents a menu with the options that can be used, the options are independent of each other.
